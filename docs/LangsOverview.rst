Language Rant
=============

Scala
-----

Pros
~~~~

One of the best langs in the world. Love it. Huge type system, quite
powerful. Dotty looks very promising.

Cons
~~~~

Very complicated combination of features affected by numerous Java
restrictions. Hence, very slow compilation Even though it has decent
syntax, it's still quite polluted with (): stuff, especially with
generics

Haskell
-------

Great language. But it has 25 years of legacy none could improve.

- Laziness may cause performance uncertainties.
- There are 5 types for strings: String, Text, Text.Lazy, ByteString, ByteString.Lazy. And
  String is the worst one, and is not recommended to use in a real
  program. And it's a default String. It's in Prelude. You can't do a thing
  without enabling at least 5 language extensions. And you have to know
  about them. And there are about 70 of those.

.. code:: haskell

	{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
	{-# LANGUAGE FlexibleInstances #-}
	{-# LANGUAGE FlexibleContexts #-}
	{-# LANGUAGE MultiParamTypeClasses #-}
	{-# LANGUAGE Rank2Types #-}
	{-# LANGUAGE DeriveGeneric #-}
	{-# LANGUAGE DeriveFunctor #-}
	{-# LANGUAGE BangPatterns #-}
	{-# LANGUAGE PatternSynonyms #-}
	{-# LANGUAGE ScopedTypeVariables #-}
	{-# LANGUAGE TupleSections #-}
	{-# LANGUAGE ViewPatterns #-}
	...

- Records are pain.
- Don't have named arguments, nor default arguments.
- And there is ``$`` operator, which only make things worth.

http://www.haskellforall.com/2015/09/how-to-make-your-haskell-code-more.html

Basically, Gabriel summarize it to several rules:

1. Don't use ($) and other weird and commonly unfamiliar operators.
2. Don't use lenses for the same reason.
3. Don't use point-free style.
4. Use do notation generously
   Meaning, write your code imperatively, don't do huge one-liners

Can't agree more.

SML/Ocaml
---------
Lots of weird syntactic decisions, like #~ prefixes for field access/named arguments.

Module system is weird. I'd consider type classes instead. Also, there
is a paper "ML Modules and Haskell Type Classes: A Constructive
Comparison", so looks those are interchangable.

::

    This article demonstrates how to translate essential features of ML modules to
    Haskell type classes and vice versa.

Agda/Idris
----------

Pros
~~~~

Great languages. Good type systems, nice and mostly clean syntax Full
type inference Dependent types

Cons
~~~~

Quite hard to grok for an average programmer
Complicated (compared to "usual" imperative lang) effect system with monads/do notations
Data immutability implies complications for an average programmer
Unusual syntax

Syntax I Consider Hard to Interpret
-----------------------------------

Space application
-----------------

Takes some time to get used to. But significantly reduces number of parens used.
It's quite readable, though

.. code:: haskell

        foo x y z = undefined
        
        foo 1 2 3

let-bindings/where-clauses
--------------------------

.. code:: haskell

        foo : Int -> Int
        foo x = case isLT of
                    Yes => x*2
                    No => x*4
            where
               data MyLT = Yes | No
        
               isLT : MyLT
               isLT = if x < 20 then Yes else No

Things defined it reverse order: firstly, isLT is used, then defined.
That's fine for mathematicians, but not ok for me. This is
isomorphic, and much more readable for a developer.

.. code:: haskell

        foo : Int -> Int
        foo x = 
            data MyLT = Yes | No -- aha, so we have MyLT
            
            isLT = if x < 20 then Yes else No -- ok, here is some checking function
            
            case isLT of -- do stuff with above -- aha, here is the actual functionality using already familiar to us things
                    Yes => x*2
                    No => x*4

Type declaration on a separate line, unnamed arguments
------------------------------------------------------

I don't like the whole idea of separate type declarations.

.. code:: haskell

        liftM   :: (Monad m) => (a1 -> r) -> m a1 -> m r
        liftM f m1              = do { x1 <- m1; return (f x1) }

I think it should be bundled with arguments name for the sake of documentintation.
This allowes us to parameters with and without explicit type declaration.

.. code:: scala

	def liftM(input, f: a => r) = ???



Type class in
-------------

Example
-------

.. code:: haskell

        class Applicative m => Monad m where
            (>>=)       :: forall a b. m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b
            (>>)        :: forall a b. m a -> m b -> m b
            m >> k = m >>= \_ -> k -- See Note [Recursive bindings for Applicative/Monad]
            
            return      :: a -> m a
            return      = pure
        
            fail        :: String -> m a
            fail s      = errorWithoutStackTrace s
        
        
        (=<<)           :: Monad m => (a -> m b) -> m a -> m b
        f =<< x         = x >>= f
        
        when      :: (Applicative f) => Bool -> f () -> f ()
        when p s  = if p then s else pure ()

        sequence = mapM id

C/C++
-----

Don't even get me started on those.

D
-

Its author was permanently harmed by C++ experience

Pros
~~~~

Uniform Function Call Syntax Macros?

Go
--

Pros
~~~~

Simplicity Fast compilation Readability defer

Cons
~~~~

Primitiveness. It's to simple. It can't do a shit. Nil Weak and
cumbersome type system. No generics. Duck-typing. Not sure if it's too
bad, though.

Rust
----

Interesting usage of kind of linear types.

Pros
~~~~

No OOP bullshit, just type-classes, ADTs and structs Type-safe memory
management. Impressive, but requires too much attention. Method-based
syntax Generics

Cons
~~~~

No GC. That's all. You can't develop fast w/o GC. No higher-kind types,
not even mentioning dependent types. Semicolons, for gods sake! Com'on,
it's 21st century already! Even JavaScript works w/o semicolons. <> for
generics is just wrong. Overall, syntax is very polluted with all that
std::io::;.,()<>{}'a&\* symbolism. It's unpleasant to read.

Swift
-----

Not bad. But it's just boring and vanilla. To explicit. ##Pros ARC

Cons
~~~~

Still cumbersome syntax, polluted with {}(). Better that C++, though,
anything is better than C++. Weird string interpolation return No real
patter-matching OOP with inheritance etc.

Julia
-----

Interesting. But dynamically typed.

Clojure
-------

Interesting. But dynamically typed. And it's a lisp. People tend to not
like working with bare AST. Compilers do.

Pros
~~~~

-  JVM
-  core.async

Cons
~~~~

-  JVM
-  Lisp

Erlang
------

Pros
~~~~

-  actors as first class citizen
-  simple
-  large infrastructure
-  widely used

Cons
~~~~

-  primitive, unexpressive?
-  no type safety (duh)
-  slow
-  weak documentation

Any dynamic language
--------------------

Writing code is the easiest part of software development. The most
interesting part comes after the code is written. Its maintenance,
changing, and refactoring – that is complex, and must be addressed.

Any sufficiently complicated program written in a dynamic language contains an ad hoc,
informally-specified, bug-ridden, unsound, and slow implementation of half of System F.

Any Java
--------

You no longer can fix that pile of crap. It's too late, Java, it's too
late.

Any .NET
--------

Don't care about any language/platform bound to a single OS. And Mono
doesn't count. And it's too late, Microsoft, to make it cross-platform.
